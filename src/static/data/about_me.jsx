                                I am a tenacious software developer who doesn't 
                                put down a problem until I find the best possible 
                                solution. After several years as an accomplished 
                                YMCA Program Director (and two time Interim CEO), 
                                more than doubling the Y's program offerings and 
                                participation during my tenure, I decided to take 
                                on the challenge of transitioning my software 
                                programming hobby into a career, giving me 
                                a greater opportunity to use my creativity 
                                and problem solving skills to create new programs 
                                that can be used by people for a long time to come.

                                When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on my
                                boat as long as weather permits.  Other hobbies
                                include lifting weights and playing video games,
                                particularly in the strategy, open world, and RPG 
                                genres.
