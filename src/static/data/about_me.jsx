                            <p>
                                I am a tenacious software developer who doesn't 
                                put down a problem until I find the best possible 
                                solution.  In my past life as a YMCA Program Director,
                                I utilized my leadership skills, project management,
                                and attention to detail to more than double the Y's 
                                program offerings and participation, further growing
                                those leadership skills during my two 
                                periods as Interim CEO.  When I decided it was time
                                for a new challenge, I opted to transition my 
                                software programming hobby into a career, giving 
                                me a greater opportunity to use my creativity and 
                                problem solving skills to build and improve programs 
                                that can be used by people for a long time to come.
                            </p>

                                When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on my
                                boat as long as weather permits.  Other hobbies
                                include lifting weights and playing video games,
                                particularly in the strategy, open world, and RPG 
                                genres.
