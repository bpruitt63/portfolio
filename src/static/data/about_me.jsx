                                I am a tenacious software developer who doesn't 
                                put down a problem until I find the best possible 
                                solution. In my past life as a YMCA Program Director, 
                                I utilized my leadership skills, project management 
                                skills, and attention to detail to more than double 
                                the Y's program offerings and participation. This 
                                opportunity also allowed me to further grow my 
                                leadership skills during two periods as Interim 
                                CEO. Eventually, I decided it was time for a new 
                                challenge, so I reflected on my interests to 
                                determine where I wanted to steer the ship on the 
                                journey that is my life.

                                I have always enjoyed working with computers and 
                                technology and jumped on any opportunity to help 
                                friends put together websites.  It was fun but also 
                                gave me a feeling of accomplishment. The opportunity 
                                to build something and satisfy my curiosity about web 
                                development was irresistible! 
                            </p>

                                When the time came to explore new career options, 
                                I decided to try an online intro to JavaScript 
                                course and was instantly hooked.  Shortly afterward 
                                I enrolled in Springboard's full stack software 
                                engineering bootcamp, and by the end of that curriculum, 
                                I knew that this is what I was meant to be doing all along.

                                When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on my
                                boat as long as the weather permits (see projects: Boatey).  
                                Other hobbies include lifting weights and playing video games,
                                particularly in the strategy, open world, and RPG genres
                                (see projects: Gamey).
